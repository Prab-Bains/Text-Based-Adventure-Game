## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:
My flowchart is in similar order as my code (from top to bottom), so my main flowchart is at the very bottom.
The warnings in my game function are the ones you told me I was allowed to ignore.

## Game Information: Some key points about my game
- Each class has unique attributes (ex. damage, health, accuracy and attacks are different for each class)
  - MMA Fighter: most damage, but least health and ok accuracy 
  - Hockey Player: good in every aspect, but not great in anything
  - Football Player: most damage, but second-lowest health and the worst accuracy
  - Baseball Player: health: , accuracy: , damage: the best accuracy, but lowest damage
- The character's health will only regenerate if the character wins the fight, not if the foe runs away
- You need to reach 100 experience to level up
- While battling if your attack is not successful, the opponent will counter you, and you will lose health
